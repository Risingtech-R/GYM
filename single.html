Yoga practice is a great way to strengthen the bond between your mind and your body. It is also a great way to learn to appreciate your body and its abilities. Our bodies carry us throughout the day, and yoga is about creating the opportunity to focus on our breathing, stretching and developing mindfulness.

As yoga does not discriminate, all levels are invited to practice. Whether it is your first time, or your 100th, your experience will be just as freeing, and calming. With the room temperature slightly warmer, your body will begin relaxing the moment you enter the room and the energy from the class will make you feel free and at ease.
